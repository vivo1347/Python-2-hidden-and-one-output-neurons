In this repository, I have 2 Python programs called neuron2.py and neuron2.1.py respectively. The initial one contains 2 neurons in series and the later one has 2 parallel in the hidden layer and then one in the output layer. The purpose of the later configuration was to allow for XOR training and prediction, which is something the previous single neuron python program and neuron2.py couldn't achieve.

The above image is the archatecture of the 2 neurons in series

The images above are for the 3 neurons in the neuron2.1.py file.











The addition of any neuron into the system is very tediuos and thus, the next program (Object-Oriented MLP) will allow for the customizability of the archatecture with ease! Below is what I have in mind for the OOM program's MLP class:
