In this repository, I have 2 Python programs called neuron2.py and neuron2.1.py respectivley. The initial one contains 2 neurons in series and the later one has 2 parallel in the hidden layer and then one in the output layer. The purpose for the later configuration was to allow for XOR training and prediction, which is something the previous single neuron python program and neuron2.py couldn't achieve.
